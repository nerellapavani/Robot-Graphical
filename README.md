# Robot-Graphical
Robot simulation involves basic robot movements such as walking, raising arms and other gestures. Specific interactive actions such as picking up objects or placing objects on a table are also implemented through an action list. The glut libraries are used to draw the basic structure of the robot and perform the basic gestures by coordination and relative motion. The robot actions are selected and controlled by the user.
DESCRIPTION:
The different actions are implemented through various modules and functions. Some of the functions are  :
o	draw – to draw the basic initial robot on the screen.
o	Position – to manipulate the robot position on the screen.
o	Walk – to perform the basic walking action from a point to another.
o	Wave – to perform the wave gesture
